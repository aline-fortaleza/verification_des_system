Notes:

** all the clients start with 0 money (no one can buy tickets)
** in the cancel section: a bug with the seats (seat |-> internalReq.seat + 1)

** Possible invariants:
- there are no clients with negative money
- the total money is conserved -> good to check malicious 
- the paid seat only belongs to one client
- one client can never end with more money than the start
- a client can't cancel a ticket that they didn't buy
- tickets ⊆ Seats 

** Possible temporal processes
- if a client wants to buy, the system will eventually respond (confirm or deny)

** TO DO:  Client can buy or cancel a ticket
